--------------
I am trying to get my way through these triangles files. 
I have some questions:

1- How do I test these functions? I have made a little canvas
framework to test the function individually. 

2- I have a lot of notes, sketches, etc. that may be useful
down the road for documentation purposes, or that may be
useful down the road. I would like to post these to my 
personal fork, perhaps in a new folder. Is this a good idea?
Or would it just confuse things?
