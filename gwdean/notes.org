Solving Oblique Triangles
http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/SolvingObliqueTriangles/

To solve an oblique triangle means to find the lengths
of the unknown sides and the measures of unknown angles.
If two angles are known, then third angle can be determined
simply by knowing that the sum of the three interior angles
must equal 180 degrees.

Both the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines are important
tools for solving oblique triangles. An oblique triangle
is one that is not right angle. Thus an oblique triangle can
be either acute or obtuse.

Things to do:

1- Figure out the "TriangleImage.prototype.render" function for
   oblique triangles.

2- Figure out how to test the functions in an appropriate way
