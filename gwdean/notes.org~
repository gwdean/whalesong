Solving Oblique Triangles
http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/SolvingObliqueTriangles/

To solve an oblique triangle means to find the lengths
of the unknown sides and the measures of unknown angles.
If two angles are known, then third angle can be determined
simply by knowing that the sum of the three interior angles
must equal 180 degrees.

Both the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines are important
tools for solving oblique triangles.
